# Design System: Rein

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "Compact white workspace"**

Rein is a compact application for operating a workspace through scoped group conversations and Agent tasks. White work areas, a pale sidebar, gray task groups and small controls keep conversation, task status and execution output visible together. Typography and spacing serve scanning and frequent interaction.

The visual authority is [Figma pzrgKXgJAyugcvBNC16Ick](https://www.figma.com/design/pzrgKXgJAyugcvBNC16Ick): main workspace `2:34`, task detail `2:35`, login `12:1111`, settings `12:1112`–`12:1116`, account menu `24:3887` and logout dialog `24:4369`. The implemented source of tokens is `src/theme.ts`; `src/App.css` and the components define layout and component details. Preserve these references when extending the application.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Compact white application surfaces with thin dividers.
- Small Inter and Noto Sans SC typography; JetBrains Mono for terminal output.
- Blue actions and selection, with explicit status text alongside status icons.
- Resizable conversation and task panes, with responsive navigation and task groups.
- Native Figma SVG assets at their intended intrinsic sizes.

## Colors

The palette is predominantly white and cool gray. Blue identifies actions, active execution and selection; status colors carry specific operational meaning. Frontmatter values are normative.

### Primary

- **Action blue** (`primary`): contained actions, focus outlines, active execution, the resize divider on interaction and selected card borders.
- **Selected pale blue** (`selected`): selected navigation, the user's message bubbles and active toolbar actions.

### Secondary

- **Completion green** (`success`): completed tasks, online presence and connected states.
- **Waiting amber** (`warning`): tasks and messages waiting for a reply.
- **Destructive red** (`error`): the logout confirmation action and error feedback.

### Neutral

- **Primary ink** (`text`) and **secondary gray** (`text-secondary`): main content and supporting labels, timestamps, descriptions and metadata.
- **White surface** (`surface`): conversation, task cards, settings and dialogs.
- **Sidebar gray** (`sidebar`): persistent navigation and the compact toolbar.
- **Muted gray** (`muted`): agent message bubbles, search and the selected settings category.
- **Task group gray** (`task-group`): the background behind task cards.
- **Divider gray** (`border`): pane boundaries, outlined controls, card borders and row separators.
- **Terminal dark** (`terminal-bg`), **terminal text** (`terminal-text`), **terminal secondary** (`terminal-secondary`) and **terminal divider** (`terminal-border`): the execution console only. **Terminal green** (`terminal-success`) and **terminal cyan** (`terminal-cyan`) distinguish output and command controls inside that surface.

**The Status Meaning Rule.** Keep waiting, execution and completion colors tied to their existing meanings. Accompany status colors with labels or icons.

## Typography

**Body and interface font:** Inter, with Noto Sans SC and sans-serif fallbacks. **Terminal font:** JetBrains Mono, with Noto Sans SC and monospace fallbacks. Chinese and Latin text share the compact hierarchy; interface labels retain their natural case.

### Hierarchy

- **Title**: panel, detail and settings headings. The login title is the larger, centered exception.
- **Body**: message content, settings labels and normal application text.
- **Label**: buttons, inputs, tabs, select values, task assignees and supporting descriptions.
- **Caption**: timestamps, counts, task IDs and saving status.
- **Task title**: medium-weight task names and small section headings.
- **Terminal**: execution output and command input, with the default size set by the terminal token.

The default body is (13px), labels (12px), captions (11px), titles (15px) and terminal output (12px). The existing preferences offer (14px) for message bubbles, assignment rows and navigation, and (13px) terminal output. They do not globally enlarge every interface element. Preserve wrapping for message and task text; truncate compact pane headings with an ellipsis.

## Layout

The application fills the dynamic viewport height. Each primary pane owns its scroll area; the shell does not scroll. The desktop sidebar is (296px) wide. At the reference width of (1600px), the initial composition is approximately (624px) conversation and (680px) tasks beside that sidebar, separated by a (1px) divider. The initial ratio is `624 / 1304`; user resizing persists locally.

Both split panes have a minimum width of (360px). Dragging the divider or using its focused left/right arrow controls changes the ratio; keyboard steps are (2 percentage points). The divider has an enlarged pointer target around its thin visible line. Hiding the sidebar gives the panes the reclaimed width.

Panel headers are (65px) high on desktop. Conversation padding is generally (20px); the task board has (16px) padding and (12px) gaps. Controls use small gaps, usually (6px) or (8px). Keep compact density instead of substituting large dashboard spacing.

Task groups form three columns when the task pane is wide. At a task-container width of (560px) or less, groups stack with intrinsic row heights and align to the top; cards form two columns within each group. Groups must grow with their cards, including wrapped titles. At (390px) or less, cards become a single column. These thresholds respond to the task pane, independently of viewport width.

At viewport widths of (1199px) or less, the sidebar is a temporary drawer, opened from the compact toolbar. At (899px) or less, a chat/tasks toggle shows one primary pane at a time and the divider is hidden. Headers become (60px) high, settings navigation becomes a horizontal strip, and content padding contracts. At (480px) or less, settings rows stack their labels and controls and select fields fill the available width.

Task detail overlays from the right. Before manual resizing, its left edge aligns with the rendered right edge of the Todo title; on mobile its initial width is the viewport width. Pointer and keyboard resizing save its fraction of the viewport width in localStorage, shared by all tasks and retained on reopening or refreshing. Window resizing scales this saved fraction, with the rendered width constrained to available workspace space and a (260px) readable floor; these constraints never overwrite the saved ratio. Pointer resizing normally stops at (360px), or at the narrower initial/current width when necessary. Expanding uses the available main-workspace width, excluding the visible desktop sidebar; restoring returns to the saved ratio. Neither changes the saved conversation/task split. At detail widths up to (480px), tabs and session controls wrap onto separate rows. Settings use a (1040px × 720px) dialog constrained by (16px) viewport margins. Login uses a centered (360px) form bounded by (20px) side margins.

## Elevation & Depth

Most surfaces are flat. Thin borders and pale backgrounds separate navigation, groups, cards and conversation. Selected cards add a blue border and a subtle (1px) halo. Elevation is structural for overlays and menus, rather than decorative card lift.

### Shadow Vocabulary

- **Right detail and dialogs** (`-6px 0 18px #1726401f`): distinguishes the task overlay or dialog from the application beneath.
- **Account menu** (`0 6px 18px #1726401f`): a small elevated menu with a thin border.
- **Selected task** (`0 0 0 1px #0866ff33`): reinforces selection without moving the card.

Modal backdrops use the theme's translucent ink (`#20263229`). Invisible dismiss backdrops, including the account menu, remain transparent so opening a menu does not dim the workspace. Task detail is a persistent right overlay with an interactive paper surface.

## Shapes

Controls, inputs, navigation rows and the terminal use gently rounded corners (`control`). Task cards, task groups, message bubbles and the composer use the larger `container` radius. Dialogs use `dialog`. Avatar circles and tiny status dots are the recurring circular forms. Borders are generally (1px); avoid turning these compact rectangles into pills.

Icons are downloaded native Figma SVG files in `public/icons`. Keep the existing source paths and intrinsic asset geometry. The logout icon is composed from `account-MaterialLogout.svg` with the nested `account-Group5.svg` glyph; preserve both layers. Settings switches also use the native on/off SVGs rather than redrawing their appearance.

## Components

### Buttons

Small, restrained actions use the shared control radius. Default buttons have a minimum height of (28px), label typography and (3px 10px) padding; icons and text have a (6px) gap. Contained buttons use action blue and white, outlined buttons use the divider border and primary ink, and text actions remain visually light. Logout confirmation uses the destructive color. Icon buttons have a (26px) square target with (5px) padding. Hover states follow MUI and the explicit source overrides; keyboard focus remains visible with a (2px) blue outline and (2px) offset.

### Inputs / Fields

Outlined fields use the divider stroke, label typography, the control radius and (7px 10px) text padding. The shared minimum height is (32px); login and standalone forms use (36px). The search field has a muted background. Focus and validation follow the MUI outlined-input states. The conversation composer is a separate multiline container with actions along its bottom edge and a compact blue send button.

### Navigation

Sidebar rows have a minimum height of (32px), (5px 8px) padding and (8px) icon gaps. Selection uses pale blue with primary ink. Project rows toggle their tree, with project chat first and leaf requirements below. Project editing appears on hover or keyboard focus. Show five projects initially, then three more per click. Collapsed navigation leaves a (56px) rail with restore and workspace/project/requirement shortcuts; the avatar stays at the bottom. Agent roster rows open direct conversations and replace Todo with Memory. Do not add Agent management or task-status children to this navigation. Settings categories use taller (36px) rows and muted gray selection. Account actions appear in a (264px) menu with (6px) paper padding; its dismiss backdrop stays transparent.

Requirements expose the same hover/focus edit affordance as projects; creation remains on the requirements heading. Projects use Material folder outlines; requirements use target flags. The project section uses the remaining sidebar height, with an independently scrollable list beneath its heading. The Agent roster stays above the pinned account, leaving room for three to five Agents; larger rosters can scroll in their own region. Search, workspace chat, Agent roster and the pinned account do not share that scroll. Collapsing navigation preserves the chat track width and gives the released (240px) to Todo or Memory. Use Claude, Codex and pi provider SVGs consistently for Alex, Sam and Robin. Each Agent row has a monochrome settings gear revealed on hover or focus, while touch inputs retain visible access. The Agents heading has a create action. Chat and Todo toolbar gears have explicit pending-function feedback.

### Cards / Containers

Task cards are white, outlined and rounded with (10px) padding and a minimum height of (132px). IDs and action menus occupy a small metadata row above the task title, assignee and execution state. Hover changes the border to `#a9b8d2`; selection uses the primary border and selection halo. Group surfaces encode pending (`#f5f2fa`), running (`#eff5ff`) and completed (`#edf7f1`) with restrained tints and existing text/dot labels. Waiting tasks remain in running and use an amber surface (`#fff9eb`), border (`#b88627`), readable text (`#8a5600`) and explicit reply badge (`#ffe5ae`). Selected waiting cards retain a separate blue outline. Cards have (10px) gaps. At narrow task-container widths, group heights follow content rather than distributing a fixed viewport height.

### Conversation

Messages pair avatars with author and time metadata. Agent bubbles use muted gray; the user's bubbles use selected pale blue and align to the right. Bubbles use body typography, the container radius and (9px 12px) padding. Long text wraps without widening the pane. Inline task assignments form bordered rows (48px) high, with task actions opening the same detail view as task cards.

The composer has no scope chip. Agent conversations use the same composer and show an illustrative, editable-vector Memory graph in the adjacent pane. Keep the planning note visible; Memory has no implemented storage or execution behavior. Project and requirement dialogs share a compact (440px × 380px) form with external labels, name and description fields, and cancel/save actions. Retain Material UI and the existing ChatGPT UI Kit reference patterns.

Agent settings reuse the (1040px × 720px) configuration dialog and row structure, with basic profile, A2A, local, SKILL and memory-storage categories. Basic profile edits name, description and provider type; identity IDs remain stable. Creation uses the same shell but keeps changes as a draft until explicit submit. Fields commit on blur; selects and switches commit immediately. Show validation inline and keep closing available. Configuration is per Agent and memory-only; the footer states this limit. On narrow screens the category bar scrolls horizontally and reveals the selected category, while the form scrolls vertically.

Header avatars show Agent names on hover and insert @mentions at the composer caret on click. Message author buttons share this behavior. Preserve the draft and focus the composer after insertion. Waiting messages share the task attention palette and an explicit reply action. Amber text contrasts at least 5:1 against its badge and surface, and the border at least 3:1 against its surface. Color is reinforced by words and the waiting icon.

### Terminal and task detail

The task detail keeps a compact header, participant/status row, description, tabs and footer around its scrollable content. CLI output uses the terminal palette, mono typography and (16px) padding. Command input is separated by a terminal divider. Running indicators rotate once per second; reduced-motion preferences stop that rotation and reduce animation and transition durations. Activity, CLI and result tabs share the compact label hierarchy.

### Settings switches and dialogs

Switch artwork is (28px × 16px), placed within a (32px) square interactive target. Keep labels and descriptions aligned to the setting row, with controls on the right until the narrow stacked layout applies. The logout dialog is (440px × 220px), constrained by the viewport, with a quiet cancel action and a red confirmation action. Native modal and menu keyboard behavior remains part of the component contract.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** use the pinned Figma nodes and implemented theme as visual authority for new screens.
- **Do** preserve the compact type hierarchy, white work areas and gray navigation and task-group surfaces.
- **Do** preserve native Figma SVG geometry and existing icon source paths, including the nested logout glyph.
- **Do** keep both desktop panes resizable with their minimum widths and persist the user's ratio.
- **Do** let stacked task groups grow to their content and switch card columns using task-container width.
- **Do** retain visible keyboard focus, labeled controls, status text and reduced-motion behavior.

### Don't:

- **Don't** replace the pinned visual system with a new metaphor, decorative palette or oversized typography.
- **Don't** dim the workspace behind the account menu's invisible dismiss backdrop.
- **Don't** force equal viewport-distributed heights onto the stacked task groups.
- **Don't** stretch native SVG icons or replace them with a different icon family.
- **Don't** turn task detail into a change to the stored conversation/task split.
